But in case you're not sure, here's my pitch: If you like beef sticks at all, then you absolutely need to try Jack Link's Original. This became my new favorite because it has a real meat flavor with a zesty tang, but not overly hot or salty. Some meat sticks taste like cardboard paste but not these. Unexpectedly, my wife, who normally shuns this sort of thing, found that she actually likes these. So I've had to buy more frequently than planned.\",\n",

I've explored numerous so-called Keto sugar-free beef sticks, and they tend to be twice as expensive as these. The key difference I observed between these sugar-free and regular beef sticks is a minimal variance of 1 gram in sugar and carbohydrates. These lean slightly toward being saltier, and each stick falls just short of reaching 1 ounce by a mere 0.08 ounces.\",\n",
    "    \"I like the fact that these are zero sugar and relatively clean ingredients. We enjoy them while traveling and keep them around for a protein snack when we are traveling. Great taste easy snack!\",\n",
    "    \"I recently discovered Jack Link's Beef Sticks, and they have become my go-to protein-packed snack. These beef sticks offer a convenient and flavorful option for those seeking a quick boost of protein on the go. I appreciate that Jack Link's Beef Sticks are made with quality ingredients and have no added MSG**. This gives me confidence in their nutritional value and ensures that I'm consuming a snack that aligns with my dietary preferences. The packaging of the beef sticks is convenient, with each stick individually wrapped. This makes it easy to grab one on the go or pack them in your bag for a quick and mess-free snack. The 0.92 oz. size is just right for a satisfying snack without feeling too heavy. With their high protein content, delicious flavor, and portable packaging, they are ideal for busy individuals looking for a quick and satisfying snack. If you're in need of a protein boost during the day, I highly recommend giving Jack Link's Beef Sticks a try.\",\n",

They have a flavor I would call normal for beef sticks. My daughter likes beef sticks but not the cheese where you have both in a package. She thought that they were great but wondered why the ends were twisted where the others were flat. I explained the differences between the 2. She thought they were good also. These are a good choice for both adults & kids. Easy to grab & stick in locker, snack bag for traveling, park, etc.\",\n",

I was more of a slim jims guy, but seeing as their prices have gone through the roof when they are even available I've been trying more jacks links products. So should you get this one? First think you should know is that the heat is real. Now I like hot and spicy, I like it a lot, I think it tastes better than less spicy and the burn doesnt really bother me much. I've even had carolina reaper buffalo wings and I thought they tasted great. But no matter how much you may like the taste, or how much tolerance you may have for the heat, this is not the case with your insides. If you eat more than 2 or 3 of these Wild Heats at a time you are really gonna feel it making it's way through your digestive track.\",\n",

I expected them to be kinda meh but these are AMAZING. They don't expire for another 6 months which is ideal and they taste a lot better than the ones I get at the gas station near me. 10/10\",\n",

These have been a great addition not only for the added protein but the flavors, the ease of being on the go with a healthy snack, and the convenience when a meal is just too much. I recommend having these on hand for adults and kids alike.\",\n",

They feel a little hard, but biting into them is soft, texture isn't stringy or as chewy as I'd like. Has a decent amount of spice, it's been awhile since I finished these, maybe a level 4-6 on a scale of 10, depending on the person, it didn't make me reach for water.\",\n",
    "    \"These are so good I've already ordered a second box! They make great snacks for anyone, but especially keto, since there is zero sugar in these. 6 grams of protein in each stick means one will keep me going between meals. They're delicious and don't last long in our house!\",\n",
    "    \"I think it‚Äôs worth the buy. I love these.\",\n",
    "    \"Taste is fine with me and the price is good. I keep one or two in the car's glove box and always carry several on my motorcycle - which can be really handy if I get a little hungry riding out in the country.\",\n",

    "    \"Been getting a case of these beef sticks every 3 months for about a year as my 3 year old loves them as a snack. I can count on the quality of product to be there and the taste is great. Never had an issue with my orders.\",\n",
    "    \"Better than chicken nuggets. Keep a couple with me so when I miss lunch or dinner I can indulge. Jack Links Original appears to be better than gas station Slim Jims. They are not peppery and slide down the throat without having to drink water. Great idea to keep one with you and avoid a triple whopper craving.\",\n",

The quality of the product was high and the freshness superior by far to other products of similar type, I had other brands that had an expiration date that was two days after I received them but these were incredibly fresh and soft and comfortable to consume I'm impressed.\",\n",

    "    \"SAVORY FLAVORS The Utz Pub Mix Barrel features a savory blend of honey mustard twistix, cheddar cheese twistix, honey mustard sesame chips, oriental rice crackers, pretzel stix, nacho bagel chips, and Worcestershire rye chips. PARTY SNACKS The combination of yummy flavors makes this the perfect party snack mix. Utz Pub Mix is easy and quick to prepare all you have to do is put it in a bowl and youll have a blend of savory, crunchy flavors. This mix is awesome\",\n",
    "    \"I wanted to make Super Bowl Sunday special. Rather than just have chips , I wanted to have a good bar mix with my non-alcoholic beer. Utz makes a very flavorful mix which is not over salted. I had mine with a big chunk of sharp cheddar cheese and crunchy vegetables. I am definitely starting a subscription. And the containers are nice. I'm going to use them as waste buckets. #recycle!\",\n",
    "    \"My Dad gets these when we make our weekly trip to the club store. They were out and I didn't want to make another trip to a further away club the next week... He REALLY likes them and I like to do what I can to make my Dad happy, y'know?!?... so I checked Amazon expecting them to be double the price of the club store. Granted, they were only 50¬¢ cheaper but free shipping versus a one hour round trip and gas and it was a no-brainer!\",\n",
    "    \"This is a great snack to munch on. I've been buying this for five years from Costco. Since they haven't had any in stock for a while, I decided to order from Amazon. Glad I did. I enjoy this snack mixture so much. A good variety of pretzels, sesame crackers and other crackers. The only thing that is lacking a handful or two of nuts and seeds. Will continue to buy. It's my go to snack.\",\n",
    "    \"Edit: May 2020. I‚Äôve ordered the Pub Mix 3 times already. I‚Äôm asked by family members to order before we even run out! Each time received it‚Äôs sealed, fresh, and crunchy! Original review: I read mixed reviews on this. I purchased the 44 oz. Pub Mix. which is almost 3 pounds, quite a lot for the low cost. I saw great reviews and negative reviews so did not know what to expect. In my experience the date was good, canister was sealed completely under the lid, and best thing was the whole mix tastes excellent. Probably the best dry snack mix I‚Äôve ever tasted to be honest. There is a perfect mix of a variety of pieces, different shapes and sizes, even some pieces that are very slightly sweetened to balance the salty, seasoned flavor! But, not too salty by any means... just right. Highly recommended.\",\n",
    "    \"size, packaging, taste, value all good\",\n",
    "    \"I bought this for my 13 year old son. I really didnt think i would like it. I thought it would have an odd taste. I was surprised at the flavors! Of course it has way more of the pieces i dont like, the breadsticks and twisty bread sticks. This isnt gardettos, but it isnt garbage either. Also, my son first bought a tub for 12$ at tractor supply. So this is a far better deal\",\n",
    "    \"YUM, YUM LOVE THESE! I picked up a container of these at a store just for little snacks. We all loved them and everything that came in this container. Many times when you get a mix similar to this you find some things inside that you don't like and pick out what you like. Not this one, In my house everyone loves every single piece. I went back to that store and they didn't have these anymore, they were just there for Christmas. I looked on line. I found these in Amazon.com. This container was over two times the weight of the one I purchased the first time, and only $2.00 more. I got a real deal here from Amazon. I would have ordered more but this was the last one in stock. I'll check back again soon and order a couple more.\",\n",
    "    \"Been ordering tubs of Utz Pub Mix for the past year an a half and all of them have been delivered intact. One had a loose inner seal, and yes a few have dates that aren't months out, but those are just best by dates or freshness guarantees and they've stayed fresher than the Goldfish milk carton I work through for my lunch snack. Good mix of snacks. Some broken pieces, but overall good.\",\n",
    "    \"Tried it, loved it, addicted to it,\",\n",
    "    \"This was orderd, shipped and received in 24 hours. Wich is amazingly fast and I couldn't be happier. The jar is tall rather than a big circumference and it has an easy to grip and open lid. The mix is good. I love all the flavors in there. The mustardy one is my favorite. I recommend this to anyone that needs a quick and clean snack to have with their domestic beer and football game. I have it with Pelegrino and Tivo recordings. There's really no complaint about anything, it's a great snack.\",\n",
    "    \"My husband bought pecans for baking. I decided I'd have a handful and ended up having several handfuls. Realizing I needed to replace them, I got on Amazon & put a bag of pecans in the cart. I then decided I should look for a snack, so I don't get into my husband's nuts again. I got the Pub Mix and then decided I should get something sweet, too. I choose cookies dipped in chocolate with a hazelnut cream. Well, I was up to $44 when I went to check out. So, I put the nuts back. The Pub Mix arrived quickly and fresh, although I had thought it would taste more like Gardetto's. Side note, my cookies were canceled due to being 'undeliverable'.\",\n",
    "    \"Savory, a hearty blend that actually has a good pretzel balance. I don't care for pretzels, and this thing didn't fall short on the savory bread twists and rye chips. This item is going to last a while too, there's quite a lot here. The canister is filled up to the lid with greatness.\",\n",
    "    \"This was very good and great value. It was very fresh an delicious. Loaded with pretzels which I loved. I have to resist buying again anytime soon because I'm on a diet and couldn't stop eating these. I will purchase again once I meet my goal. So delucious\",\n",
    "    \"Classic pub mix. This mix is great to snack on. The pretzel sticks are great, even though there are a lot of pretzels there are also cheese covered twists and plenty of other crunchy snacks inside (rye chips and sesame sticks etc). We‚Äôve bought this a number of times and keep going back to it. The container is big and lasts a long time and stays perfectly fresh inside! They also make a great place to store change when you‚Äôve finished it.\",\n",
    "    \"I eat this tasty tub until it goes empty. It lasts about 3 days. I add a 1 lb. bag of m and m trail mix to the tasty tub and it lasts about one week. I buy this fresh PUB mix from Amazon regularly. It's crunchy, tasty and addictive. Highly recommend.\",\n",
    "    \"I have ordered this Pub Mix a bunch of times but this is my first time reviewing it. I received another tub today with 3 months left until product expiration. The Mix is fresh and tastes great (although if I were the manufacturer, I'd cut down on Pretzel and Twist Stick content and increase Rice Cracker, Sesame squares and Flat Cracker content! ;-p). Amount for the price is very reasonable and since this mix contains no spicy items, this is a great mix for grown-ups and kids alike... way more interesting than Cheez-its, plain pretzels, etc. Shipping was great... hardly any breakage/crumbs. Thank You UTZ & Amazon! ;-p Recommend!\",\n",
    "    \"I ordered this because I was looking for something to eat as a small meal. I eat about 5 small meals a day as compared to the 3 regular meals that I believe most people eat (but add in snacks, and I think most people probably eat 5 times a day). When it came in, my husband actually got to it before I did. He raved about it. Once I tried it, I wholeheartedly agreed. It is excellent. It also leaves you feeling like you ate something relatively healthy, not all gross like, say, chips. We are darn near fighting over the last of it before more comes in (Thank goodness for Amazon Prime!). I would recommend purchasing multiples right from the start, because I know I regret that I did not.\",\n",
    "    \"It will be better to receive the product with a longer expiry date! mine expiry on Jan 2022!!\",\n",
    "    \"I have bought this several times. The contents are always fresh, rarely has broken pieces, and is tasty. I have recommended Utz Pub Mix to several friends and they have all told me they have gone back and purchased again. Nice mix for yourself or any group you are entertaining as there is a selection for everyone.\",\n",
    "    \"I love to snack on occasion and these are perfect. I've had these sent to a great nephew newly in the military and a young boy as just a 'thinking of you' type of thing. I'm not into health food, but as snacks go, this isn't as bad as some others. These stay fresh a long time and the kids in the family all love them once in a while. If I'm feeling a bit hungry, but not really, a small handful of these cures me right up. They're quick to grab.\",\n",
    "    \"I like the all in one snack as Im sitting at the desk with my favorite beverage or grabbing handfuls for my lunch snack bag. Utz quality is a BUY.\",\n",
    "    \"Oh my goodness! What can I say about this Pub mix! Except please don‚Äôt ever stop offering it! I have it on a subscription to send to my house as me and my family love to munch on it every night! I‚Äôll even send a container to one of our friends to get addicted to it with me at the beach! It‚Äôs a great value is a large container and it is absolutely delicious!\",\n",
    "    \"I buy this mix with every order I make. My whole family loves it. If I don't have a Pub Mix open the adult kids well anyone gets one from the pantry and opens it. If we're watching Georgia or Jaguar football an entire container is emptied. Now with the Olympic Games on the horizon I need to start stocking up now!\",\n",
    "    \"One of my all time favorites! Wish the lid hadn‚Äôt changed though, miss the slotted top - now it‚Äôs a simple flat screw on lid.\",\n",
    "    \"I love this stuff. My Dad introduced this to me about a decade ago, and since, it has been our go-to snack. It is a perfect blend of a wonderful mix of savory snacks. Better than anything else. To top it all off, it is from the largest independently held snack food company. That means supporting 'small business.' Just buy the stuff. If you've made it this far into the reviews, you know already this is fantastic. Even my dog loves this stuff. Although I usually only part with the pretzels. My slogan? Get what you love. Utz Pub Mix.\",\n",
    "    \"I found this product on a food site but it sold out, so I looked it up on Amazon. It is much less expensive than the 'buy in bulk, save a ton' website which ironically saved me even more by not having to buy 50+ dollars of giant boxes of food that ends up taking over valuable pantry space for months to come just to get free shipping. This mix of yummies really are delicious and very different from the usual bag of chex mix and if you're missing the chex, just add some! Simple!! It arrived on time, was very fresh and unfortunately, won't last long at all. Luckily I have this really great seller on Amazon that sells it at an amazing price! And now, so do you...\",\n",
    "    \"This pub mix is a flavor explosion that delights the taste buds and satisfies snack cravings like no other.

    "    \"Good mixture with lots of crunch. Yummy\",\n",
    "    \"Will keep one tub and give the 2nd tub to a friend.\",\n",
    "    \"Utz Pub Mix - 44 Ounce Barrel is a tasty snack suitable for anytime. The flavor and variety are great (the rye chips are a wee bit hard, but I can suck on those) and the seasonings are good as well. I like the resealable container that helps keep the Pub Mix fresh longer. I also like that there is no cholesterol in this mix. Utz Pub Mix is quite a bit healthier than many snack options, with low fat, carbs and sugar. There was a little settling of contents during shipping, but not much. I've ordered some snack mixes in the past where I end up with containers of tasty dust after transit. The plastic barrel seems to help with that. I would definitely order this again.\",\n",
    "    \"There is something for everyone in UTZ's pub mix! Honey mustard twistix (my fave!), cheddar cheese twistix, honey mustard sesame chips, Oriental rice crackers, nacho bagel chips, pretzel stix and Worcestershire rye chips make up the pub mix. Lots of delicious flavors. Comes in a 44oz container with a resealable lid that does a great job of keeping the mix nice and fresh. Perfect for parties and snacking. I got one for my niece to take back to college last year and she loved it. The price is incredibly reasonable; its actually quite low for the variety of snacks included and the 44oz size container. Enjoy!\",\n",
    "    \"The price makes this product worth it! You‚Äôre paying like six dollars for a big jug of trail mix basically. And it‚Äôs really delicious. At first I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan but as I had it for a while and but I snacked on it for a while it really grew on me and then I bought another one so obviously I‚Äôm a fan. I think the tastes is muted in some aspects but there‚Äôs a lot of different unique flavors within the mix and I think that helps. The two times I bought it it came fresh and delicious so I have no complaints and I recommend it because at this price it‚Äôs literally worth it just to try it.\",\n",
    "    \"My son loves this mix! I got it for him because he has been wanting to get a different kind of snack. Wow I have never heard him say so much about a product I got for him. Each time he finds a new thing he brings me 1 and only 1 lol. He's going to the UTZ website so he can figure out what all the different things are! We got this yesterday and he already has 1/4 of container gone! But I would rather these snacks than sugar snacks. We both love UTZ products anyways this just upped them more in our book! We definitely Recommend this product for a great snack anytime or for a party snack but I don't know if you would want to share lol if you have to share buy 2 jugs 1 for home and 1 to share Everyone will love and ask where you got them!!! Couldn't get a picture my son hid the jug!!!\",\n",
    "    \"This mix is so good. Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was that it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. It's huge! For $6.99 I was very pleasantly surprised. Looking at the jar, the quality of the plastic container is great, and the twist-lid design is really neat. Opening it up, you're met with a mouth watering smell of the snack mix seasonings, and will instantly want to dig in! The taste of the mix itself is great, each snack type offers a different texture and taste. If you're like me, you'll have a favorite and start picking through it to find the ones you like, but they're honestly all really good. I have to stop myself from going through half the container on the first day, they're just that tasty!\",\n",
    "    \"Sent these to my BFF as part of a care package. She has been hopsitalized with lukemia for the last three months. The barrel of crackers arrived when she was having a particularly difficult time with nausea. She called me that same day to tell me that I \\\"saved her\\\" because the crackers were the only things she could keep down. She loved them and raved about how large the container was. Evidently her husband liked the barrel too, because they mysteriously disappeared from her hospital room!\",\n",
    "    \"Very good snack\",\n",
    "    \"I just had to buy it again. I bought it for myself but apparently it is now a household favorite! Probably I will be buying a third one pretty soon. This snacks come in a generous size bottle that keeps them crisp and fresh. Different pieces have each a distinct flavor and type of crunchiness. Such a great combination of flavors that are perfect for a party or reunion, or like we do, just for snacking at home or carry some in a zip lock while running errands and such. Will be buying again for sure.\",\n",
    "    \"This Pub Mix is positively addictive. It‚Äôs not too salty and has a nice variety of flavors. I like the Asian style crackers in the mix, especially the sweet-salty sesame ones. I am not a fan of most cracker snacks and chips. But this mix is good as it goes with any drink - wine, beer or soda. I buy it to have at home and have also made gift baskets for friends with wine, cheeses and cookies.\",\n",
    "    \"Oh my goodness! I love this stuff! I am definitely going to be re-purchasing this, before the days of social distancing I would frequently purchase those massive 1kg (2.2 pounds) bags of reeses pieces, but I stopped buying them because I would eat the entire bag in one sitting. This product is amazing, all of the pieces taste wonderful, there are all unique flavors but somehow they blend together to taste amazing. I can't describe it but I think this is my new favorite snack, I love it, I will definitely be buying this again!\"\n",

    "    \"My son is a vegetarian 95% of the time (he only eats burgers from one restaurant) so as a mother I worry about protein in his diet (he‚Äôs 16). We discovered these about 3-4 years ago. We have tried other brands but this is the only one he will eat consistently and constantly. He loves the taste and that he can grab a bar on the go - before school, at lunch, before ball practice, as a snack or whenever. Convenient, tasty, and full of protein. There are also 220 mg of calcium 1 mg of iron and 1 g of fiber. Sodium is only 15% of the daily value. My biggest issue with these is that the peanut butter chocolate flavor is sometimes difficult to find and often more expensive than the other flavors.

Thirdly, the TASTE is waaayy off as compared to before. Not only that, SOY protein is actually HARDER to digest (I get stomach cramps when I have it on an empty stomach) and does not contain ALL THE ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS needed for muscle growth.

    "    \"These cookies are very tasty, fresh and so reasonably priced, even I couldn't believe it. I really like that they are individually wrapped.\",\n",
    "    \"I keep them on my coffee bar, so if someone is at our house and wants to grab one - they are available.\",\n",
    "    \"I will continue to purchase these from Amazon and I highly recommend them.\",\n",
    "    \"I was also buying these at the deli for 75 cents a piece, that was until I found out about this amazing deal. I can't stress it enough. The Oatmeal Cream Pies are incredibly delicious and it literally melts in your mouth. One particular day I ate half the box, couldn't sleep for a few hours, when I finally did I dreamt I was in space flying all the way to earth into the Atlantic ocean meeting video game characters along the way....That was a good dream\",\n",
    "    \"Living in Hawaii, it‚Äôs nice to purchase these from Amazon at mainland prices. Some are a little dried out. Overall any food that is less than here is a bargain and this qualifies. If you live in mainland USA, I would buy these at a store.\",\n",
    "    \"For the price nothing comes close to these cookies. I eat these during my break to keep my blood sugar stable.\",\n",
    "    \"Arrived November 20th best by date Dec.7.23. Tastes good but a little tougher than the fresh-bought ones, not as soft.\",\n",
    "    \"Little Debbie is a classic snack cake that has been around a long time. They are a nice little sweet snack.\",\n",
    "    \"It‚Äôs a classic that brings back childhood memories. I like that each cream pie is individually wrapped. The cream pies were amazing. The pricing was also great. I do wish they were a little bit bigger.\",\n",
    "    \"I was craving these Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies after not having had them for decades. It was so nostalgic to eat them again. My mom used to buy these really often. My sister and I were allowed to have these when we got home from school. We would sit at the kitchen table and have one of these each with a glass of carefully poured milk. We were allowed to have a snack before dinner, which wasn't until 7 pm. These Little Debbie's were always one of my favorite treats. I think my mom bought them because she thought since they were made with oats they must be healthy. They're sweet, yummy and really are good with milk or coffee.\",\n",
    "    \"Great price, but when it came time to chow down it tasted old to me.\",\n",
    "    \"These came in quickly and were very fresh.\",\n",
    "    \"This 12-pack of oatmeal cream pies is a great buy. Each cream pie comes individually wrapped, making it easy to space these out and pace yourself or to eat them on-the-go. This is a classic going back generations, and it makes it to my list of comfort foods for my sweet tooth. The kids love them as well. The convenience of home delivery makes this even better, improving the overall value and convenience. Very nice!\",\n",
    "    \"There‚Äôs not much to say, it‚Äôs LIL‚Äô DEBBIE! If you‚Äôve never tried them‚Ä¶WHY?? They‚Äôre soo delicious, you‚Äôll think they just came out of the OVEN and cooled off! Do yourself a FLAVORFUL FAVOR and TRY IT! You won‚Äôt regret it, unless you don‚Äôt like CAKE, that is!\",\n",
    "    \"It was soo good it's to die for highly recommended.\",\n",
    "    \"Each one is individually wrapped and easy to take to go. Great oatmeal flavor with just enough sweetness. So glad we could buy these on Amazon.\",\n",

Thank you, Amazon!\",\n",
